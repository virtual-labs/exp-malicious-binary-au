        "a": "Wireshark is a network protocol analyzer and is used to monitor network traffic.",
        "b": "Dependency Walker is used to analyze the libraries and dependencies a binary uses. Learn more <a href='https://dependencywalker.com'>here</a>",
        "c": "IDA Pro is primarily used for disassembly and reverse engineering.",

      "question": "What method can be used to identify the domain or IP a malicious binary connects to?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Checking the binary's file signature",
        "b": "Examining the Import Table",
        "c": "Monitoring the network traffic",
        "d": "Using a debugger"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "File signatures help identify file types, not network connections.",
        "b": "The Import Table shows the libraries used by the binary, not the network connections.",
        "c": "Network traffic monitoring allows you to see the actual domains or IPs the binary connects to. Learn more <a href='https://www.wireshark.org'>here</a>",
        "d": "A debugger is useful for inspecting runtime behavior, but network traffic gives direct insight into connections."
